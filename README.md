# Hamming kata - bootstrap

This project contains a bootstrap for the resolution of the [Hamming Kata](http://exercism.io/exercises/ruby/hamming/readme). Feel free to fork it and start to resolve the code challenge.

:warning: The repository doesn't have the objetive to show the kata solution. At least on `master` (did you get it? :wink:).
